# Droplet Volume Calculating

This project is for the paper entitled "3D-printed carboxymethyl cellulose aerogels".

## Backgrounds (Sujie)
To estimate the real pressure exerted on the solution in the needle, glycerol as a representative Newtonian fluid was selected.the volume of the extruded glycerol droplet as a function of time was recorded using a Nikon 1 J5 camera with a Nikkor 105 mm Macro lens (400 frames per second) to determine the flow rate  ; needles were of diameter 0.6 mm and lengths from 13.45 mm to 31.95 mm. The videos were converted into images using Davinci Resolve 18 software. 

## Calculation methods (Sujie)
the code was developed to analyse the images and calculate the volume of glycerol droplets based on slicing droplets and estimating their volume approximating them by a stack of cylinders. 

## Requirements (Ganglin)
